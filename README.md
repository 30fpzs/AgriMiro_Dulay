AgriMiro is a Miro Web SDK Integration designed to simplify the infinite whiteboard into a logistics and market-intelligence hub for local small-scale Filipino farmers.

Problem: Small-scale Filipino farmers suffer from Information Asymmetry, a power imbalance where middlemen can control market data and force the farmers to sell at a lower price like a "trap".

AgriMiro can help solve this problem, by using Miro A.I. to perform RAG-based synthesis on real-time market data (based on data from Department of Agriculture price trends, logistics routes, supply/demand, and weather patterns).

Workflow:
1) Data Dumping: Farmers input harvest data via a simplified Miro widget or conversational A.I. chat box (sidekick) that uses simplified language to not overwhelm farmers with cognitive load. This uses Miro's Headless API so that farmers do not get overwhelmed from a heavy and complex board.

2) Logic Generation: Miro A.I. takes the information, and generates a Spatial Data Visualization, including a map layout of best transport routes, best sell areas, and best suppliers. An example is showing a color-coded map that highlights the best and worst areas to sell, based on reputational based buyer risk and the supply/demand for that specific area.

3) Automated Calculations: Using Miro's Metadata API, the tool creates interactive "Sticky Notes" that shows real time calculation costs, showing the peak selling price of their goods. This allows farmers to visualize where and how they can save the most and sell the most, without falling to predatory middleman fees that scam them of their hard earned goods.

4) Scalable System: The system utilizes Miro's database to track seasonal trends, adjusting to the seasons to suggest future harvest demands (things like what crops are best to sell at this time and where to sell them) that also adjusts the Dynamic Supply Chain Map so the farmers don't have to re-do the entire workflow again.

5) The Social ROI: By bridging the Information Asymmetry gap, AgriMiro can potentially increase their net profits for small-scale farmers. These farmers can now leverage data  and can reduce the risk of being tricked by predatory middleman fees. All without spending hours researching on heavy technical and logistical terms.

AgriMiro is not just for one farmer, but a Collaborative Ecosystem made for local FARMERS. It allows the farms in an area to negotiate and collaborate with one another to help and flourish the community's produce market.

AgriMiro's mission is to support the Filipino farmers' business, so they no longer get treated unfairly by profit hungry corporations.

This demo website I made is simply a visual representation of what can happen with the right tools and time.

I hope I can make an impactfull change with my idea!
